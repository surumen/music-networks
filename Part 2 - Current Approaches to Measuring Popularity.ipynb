    "> Michael Jackson's 1982 album ***Thriller*** which is the most popular album of all time peaked in 1983. After its release, it was No. 1 on Billboard 200 Charts for [37 weeks](https://www.billboard.com/music/michael-jackson/chart-history/billboard-200/song/181096). Gradually afterwards, it moved down the charts until 2009 when it resurfaced again. For the first time in Billboard charts history, [all Top 10 positions](https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/268174/remembering-michael-jackson-king-of-charts) were occupied by one artist as Jackson took each spot in the weeks of July and August."
